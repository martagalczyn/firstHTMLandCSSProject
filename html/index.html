                    four thousand miles down, I think - ' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
                    her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge,
                    as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ' - yes, that's about
                    the right distance - but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what
                    Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)"</p>
